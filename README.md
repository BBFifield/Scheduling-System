# About

This was a school project finished by me as part of a group of three which allows Academic institutions to make a schedule for the school year. Logging in as an administrator grants you access to the necessary tools required to make an event based schedule for any semester desired. As a user of the system, you get to request an activity for any room available, then the request gets sent to the admin to be either accept or denied.
